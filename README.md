## Data Exploration and Analysis (EDA):

Understand the dataset's structure, dimensions, and types of data.

Explore the distribution of each feature and target variable.

Visualize relationships between features and the target variable using appropriate plots and charts.

Identify potential patterns, trends, and outliers.

## Data Cleaning:

Identify and handle missing values appropriately (imputation).

Address any inconsistencies or errors in the data.

Ensure data integrity and consistency.

## Feature Engineering:

Select relevant features based on domain knowledge and exploration.

Create new features that might improve predictive performance.

Convert categorical variables into numerical representations (one-hot encoding).

Scale or normalize numerical features if needed.
